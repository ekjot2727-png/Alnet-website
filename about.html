            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded on the principle of lifelong connection, ALNET was conceived at our campus in Jhalrapatan, Rajasthan, in September 2025. We recognized that the incredible talent graduating from our university was spreading across the globe, but their connection back to their alma mater and to current students was becoming fragmented. ALNET was built to be the digital bridge, a single, powerful platform to reunite this scattered network and harness its collective potential.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>To solve the critical challenge of disconnected alumni data by providing a reliable, centralized system. We aim to strengthen lifelong institutional relationships, foster a culture of mentorship, and enhance career and fundraising opportunities for our entire community at the Government-University of Punjab in Jhalrapatan.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>We envision a future where every student and alumnus is part of a continuously engaged, supportive, and powerful network. ALNET will be the digital backbone that transforms our alumni into a global force for professional growth, innovation, and institutional advancement, solidifying our university's legacy for generations to come.</p>
